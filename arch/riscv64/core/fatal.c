 * hardware or software.
 *
 * The caller is expected to always provide a usable ESF.  In the event that the
 * fatal error does not have a hardware generated ESF, the caller should either
 * create its own or use a pointer to the global default ESF <_default_esf>.
 *
 * @param reason the reason that the handler was called
 * @param pEsf pointer to the exception stack frame
 *
 * @return This function does not return.
